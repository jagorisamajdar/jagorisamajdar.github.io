Hi There! I'm Jagori, recently moved to Bangalore, India
after spending 5 years in Sydney with my husband. Before moving to Australia, I
was working as Lead Quality Assurance in few of the India’s largest classified
portals. I do consider myself detail oriented with an eye for perfection and I
enjoyed being in Quality.<br>
These past few years, I have had the most amazing
experiences, interacting with people of different society, learning new
language (Mandarin), volunteering at a Local council library located near Sydney’s
most famous Manly beach and teaching and helping the local community especially
the elderly become at ease with the technology. Volunteering also helped me
discover my passion which is learning and sharing them with other people and
hence the idea of starting this blog.<br>
It gives me immense satisfaction knowing that I could bring
a difference to some if not many people’s lives simply through sharing whatever
little I knew. And along the way, I made some wonderful friends and learnt so
many new things.<br>
<em>Now all of you reading this must be thinking how it all
  connects to Virtual Reality...</em><br>
While I was volunteering at the library, I had the
opportunity of working on another project of theirs (360 degree Virtual
library) which had taken a backstage due to various reasons and they were
really excited to let me work on it. The model was already in place and so I
did a lot of research and effort to convert the Unity project to an Android app
compatible with the Google Cardboard headset. Along with that I also created a
360 deg tour of the library by making use of a software called Kolor Panotour
which takes a series of autostitched panoramic photos (snapped using Ricoh Theta
S camera) and created a website of it. This project was highly appreciated at
the library council and I delivered a short presentation of it to the DGM of
library. <br>
One thing led to another, I attended various meetups to
learn more about the technology, explored various other headsets like the Samsung
Gear VR, Occulus Rift and even the Microsoft Hololens. Particularly in one of
the meet ups I came across a 64 year old lady who was there just to explore
various devices, especially she was looking for some Google Cardboard apps for
her daughter who was mentally challenged and she said in all these years this
was the first time, she found her daughter responding particularly to these
apps. I was overwhelmed with how much a technology can offer to people despite
age and situation. <br>

No, I am not moving away or changing my career, I am simply taking
a break to learning something new and I hope to see it reach the hands of
people out there who really need it. I do not have an extensive background in
coding or gaming technology. I will be learning by doing mostly which is what I had been doing while working on the project.</p>
