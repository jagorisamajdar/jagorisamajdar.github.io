  <h2>{{page.title}}</h2>
<p>Hi There! I'm Jagori, recently moved to Bangalore, India after spending 5 years in Sydney with my husband. Before moving to Australia, I
was working as a Lead Quality Assurance in two of the India’s largest classified portals. I do consider myself detail oriented with an eye for
perfection and I enjoyed being in Quality.</p>
<p>These past few years, I have had the most amazing experiences, interacting with people of different cultures, learning a new
language (Mandarin), volunteering at a Local council library located near Sydney’s famous Manly beach and teaching, helping and familiarising the local
community especially the elderly with technology trends.</p>
<p>Volunteering also helped me discover my passion which is learning and sharing with other people and hence the idea of starting this blog.
It gives me immense satisfaction knowing that I could bring a difference to people’s lives simply through sharing whatever little I knew. And along the way, I made some wonderful friends and learnt so many new things.</p>
<p><em>Now, those of you reading this must be thinking how it all connects to Virtual Reality...</em></p>
<p>While I was volunteering at the library, I had the opportunity of working on another project of theirs (360 degree Virtual library) which had taken a backseat for various reasons and they were
really excited to let me work on it. Since the model was already in place, with some research and effort I converted the Unity project to an Android app
compatible with the Google Cardboard headset.</p>
<p>Along with that I also created a 360 degree tour of the library by making use of a software called Kolor Panotour which takes a series
of auto stitched panoramic photos (snapped using Ricoh Theta S camera) and created a website out of it. This project was highly appreciated at the library
and I delivered a short presentation of it to the library management.</p>
<p>One thing led to another, I attended various meetups while working on the project to learn more about the technology, exploring other
headsets like the Samsung Gear VR, Oculus Rift and even the Microsoft HoloLens.</p>
<p>In one of the meet ups I came across a 64 year old lady who was there to explore various devices, she was looking for some Google
Cardboard apps for her daughter who was mentally challenged and she said in all these years this was the first time, she found her daughter responding to these apps. I was overwhelmed with how much technology can offer people despite various circumstances.</p> 
<p>The challenge of building and learning something new on my own right from researching the right software for creating photo tours, exploring cameras for taking photographs, coordinating with people both inside the library as well as outside, installing app on the
Android device and seeing it through Google Cardboard headset in just few months was amazing. This wouldn’t have been possible without the encouragement
and faith shown towards me by my library technical coordinator Theo Stephens and the other staff members.</p> 
<p>No, I am not moving away or changing my career, I am simply taking a break to learning something new and I hope to see it reach the hands of
  people out there who really need it.</p><p> I do not have an extensive background in coding or gaming technology. I will have to learn as and whatever is required which is what I had been doing all along while working on the project.
I have a fair idea about the applications of VR but I haven’t yet thought over any specific application/project I want to build as a final project.</p>
  <p>For now, my objective is to build a simple project which helps me learn the basics.</p>
